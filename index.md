## About me 

![Name Banner](../Images/NameBanner.png)

My name is Matthieu Limelette. I'm a Belgian 3rd year Game Development student at Digital Arts & Entertainment.

I've always been interested in games. First by playing them, and later by wanting to know how they worked, and now finally, getting to learn how to make them!
I'm especially interested in game engines and graphics.
